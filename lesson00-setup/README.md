# Lesson #0 SETTING UP

### Setup

The objective of today's lesson is to get you set up with your environment. You will be using VSCode, GitHub, and your terminal to participate in class. By the end of this lesson you should have a working IDE and be able to run tests against the code you create. You should also be able to push your changes to github.

### VSCODE

[Visual Studio Code Homepage](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

If you don't have VS Code Installed on your machine please make sure that you do so now.

### Terminal

Once you have VS Code installed. Select "Terminal" from the navigation menu. And then click on "New Terminal." This will open a new terminal inside your IDE. From here you should navigate to where you'd like to keep your "Pursuit" coursework. Next you'll be cloning a github repo.

### Github

[Github](https://github.com/)

- Log in to github.

  - Make sure that you have the proper credentials and are able to log in.
  - Navigate to this repo. https://github.com/pursuit-l3/winter-2025-technical-interview-practice
  - Create your own fork, copy the link to the fork

### Terminal

- In VS Code, open the terminal by using the app menu Terminal > New Terminal
- Navigate to the directory of your choice, then use `git clone [your fork link]`
- Now you can cd into the repo and run `npm install` to get the needed node modules.

## Warm-up (10 minutes)

Once you have everything set up open the `warmup.js` file in this directory. Complete the instructions there. Then go into your terminal, make sure your prompt is operating in this directory and type...

```
node warmup.js
```

If you followed the instructions, you'll see something like: "Hello, my name is [your name] and I am from [your hometown]."

## Written Question (5 minutes)

Each class will also have a "Written Question." These will typically ask you to do a bit of critical thinking about a topic. You will then slack your response to a given channel. Today's question is 
"What are you interested in learning over the next couple of months in L3?"
-DSA 
-Algorithms
-Time and Space complexity

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)

Take a look at the `problem.test.js` file in this directory. There you will see a test. Take a look at it and determine what it is testing for. Then go into the `problem.js` file and change the function there in order to satisfy the test. Confirm the tests pass by going to the terminal and typing:
`npm run test ./lesson00-setup/problem.test.js`. This is how we will complete and test our problems in this class.

## Checkout (5 minutes)

We should commit all the work the work we did today.
In terminal

## Recap (10 minutes)

In today's lesson, we focused on setting up our development environment. We started by installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and ensuring that we have the necessary credentials to log in to GitHub. We also explored how to use the terminal and ran a warm-up exercise, and tested a solution to a problem using Node.js.
