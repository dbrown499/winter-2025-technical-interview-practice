# Lesson 2: Advanced Debugging Strategies

## Warm-up (15 minutes)

### Syntax Problem (10 minutes):

- Identify and fix the scope issues in a JavaScript closure.

### Written Question (5 minutes):

- How do unit tests help in the debugging process?

Unit tests help in the debugging process by catching errors early, ensuring code behaves as expected, and isolating problems to specific parts. They act as a safety net, letting you know when changes break functionality, making debugging more efficient.

### Topic (20 minutes)

## Lecture: Advanced Debugging Tools and Techniques

- Using console tools effectively

Leverage console.log(), console.error(), console.table(), and console.time() to track values, errors, and performance.
Use console.trace() to trace the execution path and identify where issues occur.

- Advanced breakpoints (conditional, hit count)
- Memory leak identification and resolution
