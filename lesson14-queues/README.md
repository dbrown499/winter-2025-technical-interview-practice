# Lesson 13: Queues

## Warm-up (10 minutes)

## Written Question (5 minutes)
Explain the key difference between a stack and a queue. Why might you choose one data structure over the other?

Stacks- The last element to be pushed into the array is the first element to be popped out. Stacks is good for undo/redo features and for backtracking certain steps in order.

Queues- You add elements to the back of the array but remove from the front. Queues is good for processing elements in the order they are added.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Queue Basics
1. Definition of a Queue
   - FIFO (First In, First Out) principle
   - Comparison with stacks

2. Queue Operations
   - Enqueue
   - Dequeue
   - Peek/Front
   - IsEmpty

3. Implementation
   - Using arrays
   - Using linked lists

### Real-World Applications
- Print job scheduling
- Order processing systems
- Breadth-first search in graphs

### Performance Analysis

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)
Practice problems to implement and use queues effectively.

## Recap (15 minutes)
Review the core concepts of queues and their implementations.
