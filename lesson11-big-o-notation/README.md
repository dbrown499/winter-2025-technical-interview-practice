## Warm-up (10 minutes)

## Written Question (5 minutes)

What are some calculating shortcuts that you like to use in your daily life. What are some of your favorite short cuts in general.

I enjoy eating while watching a TV show because by the time the show ends, Iâ€™ve also finished my meal, allowing me to move on to the next task. I also appreciate time-saving conveniences like dishwashers, washers, dryers, and transportation vehicles. These tools complete tasks much faster than if I had to do everything manually.

## Lecture Content (20 minutes)

### Refresher in Big O Notation:

    Definition and significance in measuring the efficiency of algorithms.

Focus on constant time complexity (O(1)): Explain with examples like accessing a specific element in an array, checking if a stack is empty, etc.

### Key Concepts:

Why constant time operations are critical for performance.
Contrast with other complexities like O(n), O(log n).

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)

Problem: Implement a function that determines if a given year is a leap year. This should ideally run in O(1) time.
