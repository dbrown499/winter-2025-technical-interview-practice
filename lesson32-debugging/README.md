# Lesson 1: Debugging Basics

## Warm-up (15 minutes)

- Syntax Problem (10 minutes): Debug a short JavaScript function that incorrectly uses variable scopes.
- Written Question (5 minutes): Describe the importance of reading error messages when debugging.

Reading error messages when debugging is crucial because they help pinpoint the problem and identify its location in the code.

## Topic (20 minutes)

### Lecture: Introduction to Debugging Techniques

- Understanding error messages
- The importance of breakpoints
- Step-by-step execution in an IDE

## Problem Solving (35 minutes)

Debugging Exercises:
Independent (10 minutes): Debug a function that sorts an array but fails to handle negative numbers.
Pair Programming (10 minutes): Debug a JavaScript event handler that doesnâ€™t trigger as expected.
Pair with AI (15 minutes): Use an AI debugging tool to find errors in asynchronous JavaScript code.

## Recap (10 minutes)

Review the syntax problem and the written question from the warm-up.
Discuss the solutions to the in-class debugging problems.
Feedback: Quick survey on the day's lesson and materials.

## End Class (5 minutes)

- Encourage students to push their corrected code to their GitHub fork.
- Fill out a checkout form reflecting on confidence with today's materials.
- Review links to additional resources like debugging tutorials on YouTube or relevant chapters in programming books.
