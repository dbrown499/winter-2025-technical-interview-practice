### Warm-up (10 minutes)

### Written Question (5 minutes)

**Question:** Why do you think it's important to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm?

To make sure the algorithm doesnt timeout or consume alot of memory. Also to make sure the algorithm is able to retrieve information from given data and display it. 

Provide one example where inefficient code could cause real-world problems.

Letâ€™s say a user wants to listen to their favorite song but the search algorithm is inefficient this will cause long wait times. That may cause the user to deem that music platform as inconvenient.

(Allow students to write a brief response. This question helps set the stage for why big O notation is critical in computer science and software engineering.)

### Lecture Content (20 minutes)

1. **Definition and Importance**

   - Define big O notation as a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, often used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
   - Explain why it's crucial for understanding the scalability and efficiency of algorithms, especially in resource-limited applications or large-scale data processing.

2. **Common Big O Notations**

   - Discuss the most common big O complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n), and O(n!).
   - Show simple algorithm examples for each complexity: constant time, linear time, quadratic time

3. **Visualizing Big O**

   - Use graphical representations to compare how different functions grow. Graph the number of operations versus the size of the input for various complexities.

4. **Best, Worst, and Average Cases**
   - Describe how algorithms can have different complexities depending on the input and how big O focuses on the worst-case scenario to ensure algorithm robustness.
